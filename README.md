# Low-power-ASIC-designs-based-on-CPF
This repository contains part of our work done to infer power intent at a higher level of abstraction i.e. at the system-level. The designs span from simpler basic computing blocks to more practical HW acclerators. The RTL files have been generated by the cadence C-to-Silicon compiler and synthesized using Nangate 45nm library using Cadence RTL compiler. The TCF files have been generated using Cadence NCSim for simulation.
